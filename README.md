## To Improve 
Responsiveness, consider framing and how it'll work on various form factors.
Needs sounds coming in sooner then later.
Consider how entities will path in and out, are they animated at all?


## Path to implementation

One, Single click, resource comes and goes.

Two, Enticements can be purchased
Is order important, are the stats visible.

Sound design? 

## Principle narrative.

### Role and background???
God sim genera...
Maybe it's a party, you're one room in the party.

### Player narrative
Survival goes...   Happiness points ticks down,
Eventually you have to eat a guy to survive...

Bloody mess... Life drains away....
Eventually people start coming again, have to choose the right moment.

## Mechanics
### Building a room
Build happy things in your room to attract people

### Room impersonate rooms, eat people.
People are the consumable, suck their souls out?
Consumable resource as people in the room.

### People come and go into the room
Different attributes?
Heroes?
Recognizable characters?

Different types of people you can attract?

### Finite space, filling up
'Low-value', try to attract high value people.

### Easily recognizable rooms
Recognizable items, is this asset expensive?
Could we use sketchup as a source of assets?

### Accumulation
But like sim city... If you starve you lose.

### Filling a room, Inflection point
There are growth points...
Milestones?
Make the decision to grow?

Consume all the people in one go and grow?
Inflection point, pull the trigger.

Eat everyone, your room will be empty for a while?

### Number of people in the room grows..
One click...
Pick a time to grow

### Level two
Enticements...

### Monster room
Battling the people in the room.
Consume your resources?

Eat people too soon, people run away.
